# E-commerce_Recommender_System
This project involves building a recommender system for an e-commerce platform using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a technique that recommends items based on the preferences of similar users. The system will recommend products to users based on their past purchase history and purchase histories of similar users.
Dataset
The Dataset used in this project is provied by Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform. The dataset contains information about orders, customers, and products sold on the platform. There are eight files in the dataset:
olist_customers_dataset.csv
olist_geolocation_dataset.csv
olist_order_items_dataset.csv
olist_order_payments_dataset.csv
olist_orders_dataset.csv
olist_products_dataset.csv
product_category_name_translation.csv

Tasks 
The project involves completing the following tasks:
Data processing: Clean and merge the dataset to prepare it for building the recommender system.
Build the recommender System: Implement a collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend products to users.
Evaluate the recommender system: Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the recommender system.
Sentiment analysis: Analyze customer reviews to extract additional intelligence about the dataset.

Conclusion 
This project demostrates the use of collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for an e-commerce platform. By evaluating the system using appropriate metrics, we can understand its strengths and weaknesses and improve its performance. Additionally, sentiment analysis can provide additional insights about the dataset and help improve the system further.
